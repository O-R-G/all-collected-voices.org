- announcements of upcoming events and sessions
that will have a heading/title, dates and possibly (not always) an
accompanying text or description. The actual recordings will eventually
replace the announcements.
- other audio files
- photographs
- re:announcements: some events/conversations will be announced in advance,
some will be spontaneous, for example we might say: TODAY!
- Perhaps in terms of how they appear, the most recent should be on top?
